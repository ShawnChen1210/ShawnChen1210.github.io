                <h1 class="lora-bold large">Legacy during Mao's rule</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="lora">Shortly after Lu Xun's death, Mao Zedong called him "the saint of modern China", but
                    used his legacy selectively to promote his own political goals. In 1942, he quoted Lu out of context
                    to tell his audience to be "a willing ox" like Lu Xun was, but told writers and artists who believed
                    in freedom of expression that, because CCP areas were already liberated, they did not need to be
                    like Lu Xun. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, CCP literary theorists
                    portrayed his work as orthodox examples of communist literature, yet every one of Lu's close
                    disciples from the 1930s was purged. Mao admitted that, had Lu survived until the 1950s, he would
                    "either have gone silent or gone to prison".</p>

            <div class="p3-text2">
                <p class="lora">Party leaders depicted him as "drawing the blueprint of the communist future" and Mao
                    Zedong defined him as the "chief commander of China's Cultural Revolution," although Lu did not join
                    the party. During the 1920s and 1930s Lu Xun and his contemporaries often met informally for
                    free-wheeling intellectual discussions, but after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 the
                    Party sought more control over intellectual life in China, and this type of intellectual
                    independence was suppressed, often violently.<br>During the Cultural Revolution, the CCP both hailed
                    Lu Xun as one of the fathers of communism in China, yet ironically suppressed the very intellectual
                    culture and style of writing that he represented. Some of his essays and writings are now part of
                    the primary school and middle school compulsory curriculum in China.</p>

                <h1 class="lora-bold large">Influence on modern Chinese literature</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="lora">Lu Xun's importance to modern Chinese literature lies in the fact that he contributed
                    significantly to nearly every modern literary medium during his lifetime. He wrote in a clear lucid
                    style, which was to influence many generations, in stories, prose poems and essays. Lu Xun's two
                    short story collections, Nahan (Call to Arms) and Panghuang (Wandering), are often acclaimed as
                    classics of modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun's translations were important at a time when foreign
                    literature was seldom read, and his literary criticisms remain acute and persuasively argued.</p>

                <h1 class="lora-bold large">Overseas recognition</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="lora">The work of Lu Xun has also received attention outside China. In 1986, Fredric Jameson
                    cited "Diary of a Madman" as the "supreme example" of the "national allegory" form that all Third
                    World literature takes. Gloria Davies compares Lu Xun to Nietzsche, saying that both were "trapped
                    in the construction of a modernity which is fundamentally problematic". According to Leonardo
                    Vittorio Arena, Lu Xun cultivated an ambiguous standpoint towards Nietzsche, a mixture of attraction
                    and repulsion, the latter because of Nietzsche's excesses in style and content. A major literature
                    prize in China, the Lu Xun Literary Prize is named after him, Asteroid (233547) 2007 JR27 was named
                    after him, A crater on Mercury is named after him.</p>
